Send your Contact Form 7 data directly to your Less Annoying CRM account. 

== Description ==

This plugin is a bridge between your [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) forms and [Less Annoying CRM](https://www.lessannoyingcrm.com/Tour)  

When a visitor submits his/her data on your website via a Contact Form 7 form, upon form submission, such data are also sent to your Less Annoying CRM account.  

The plugin creates a new contact in LACRM, and can create new pipelines, tasks, and notes as necessary.  

= How to Use this Plugin =
Please see [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lacrm-connector-for-contact-form7/screenshots/) to see settings details.  
- Create or Edit the Contact Form 7 form from which you want to capture the data. Set up the form as usual in the Form and Mail etc tabs. Thereafter, go to the new LACRM tab.  
- On the LACRM tab you need to map the form fields on to LACRM fields. For each LACRM field, provide the corresponding Contact Form 7 mail tag, the same way you do on the Mail tab.  
- If you'd like to create a Pipeline in LACRM for this newly created contact, you can provide LACRM Pipeline info.  
- If you'd like to create a Task in LACRM attached to this newly created contact, you can provide details of the task, including when it is due and which LACRM user it is for.  
- Test your form submit and verify that the data shows up in your LACRM.
- Have a beer and celebrate!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is an Less Annoying CRM? =

= Is Contact form 7 required? =

- Yes [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) is a prerequisite.

= Why to use this plugin? =

= How do I know it's working? =

- Try submitting a form, and then search for those details in Less Annoying CRM. If the details appear in the search results, it works!

= The submitted information was not sent to LACRM. Now what? =

- Most often the reason is that the Site Admin skipped step 3 of Installation. Step 3 tells this plugin the details it needs to connect to LACRM. If the plugin doesn't have these details, it's like not having the username and password for an LACRM account...hence the plugin can not log into LACRM and add any info.

= Where can I find the LACRM user code and token required in step 3 of Installation? =

- On the [LACRM API page](https://www.lessannoyingcrm.com/account/api/)
